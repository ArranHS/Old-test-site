 <p align="center">Hello<br>
Now, this is a story all about how<br>
My life got flipped-turned upside down<br>
And I'd like to take a minute<br>
Just sit right there<br>
I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel Air<br>

In west Philadelphia born and raised<br>
On the playground was where I spent most of my days<br>
Chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool<br>
And all shootin some b-ball outside of the school<br>
When a couple of guys who were up to no good<br>
Started making trouble in my neighborhood<br>
I got in one little fight and my mom got scared<br>
She said 'You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel Air'<br>

I whistled for a cab and when it came near<br>
The license plate said fresh and it had dice in the mirror<br>
If anything I could say that this cab was rare<br>
But I thought 'Nah, forget it' - 'Yo, homes to Bel Air'<br>

I pulled up to the house about 7 or 8<br>
And I yelled to the cabbie 'Yo homes smell ya later'<br>
I looked at my kingdom<br>
I was finally there<br>
To sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel Air<br>
